# Data Analysis of Connecticut Warrant Information

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this little project came when I heard about an unsubstantiated warrant signing and got curious about the data, only to find out there was next-to-nothing online. The only data I could find comes from the state of Connecticut, which their Office of Policy and Management has been releasing data since 2006 [here](https://portal.ct.gov/OPM/CJ-CJIS/CJ-Arrest-Warrant-Data/Arrest-Warrant-Data). 

## Format of the Github

The data folder contains all scripts and data related to this project. It also has an accompanying README file that details what each script does. The analysis and results can be seen in the current folder in [ConnWarrantAnalysis.ipynb](./ConnWarrantAnalysis.ipynb).

To do list:
1. Fix column names for race, ethnicity, and age   
2. Visualize basic relationships between the different variables
3. Plot with geographic and temporal data
4. See if there is any statistical relationship with town population data and warrant information

## Future Analysis

Since there is data extending back for a significant number of years, the next steps are to look at how the data changes from year to year.
